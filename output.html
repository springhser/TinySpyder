Question_title: Python for Machine Learning?
Question_details:Hi,I'm planning to learn python mainly  to work on machine learning as well as some open source projects. Right  now i'm familiar with c/c++ mainly through solving  problems on SPOJ,  etc. I've tried selectively learning it through the documentation  (mainly the corresponding features of c++), but i feel i'm missing out  on the python specific ones. I'm looking for some resources which could  guide me through the main features of python(websites, videos would do).  Also i've seen a lot many people on  websites like hackerrank using Python2 over Python3 for the machine  learning challenges. Is it got to do with more ml specific libraries in  Python2 ?Any Advice would be much appreciated!

 Answer_content:I don't know your purpose. If you want to implement your own "ML alghorithms" prototypes, then you should use numpy/scipy as suggested  in other answers. However remember, that there is a difference betwen "use" and "effective use". For example:Speeding up Python (NumPy, Cython, and Weave)There are also PyOpenCL, gnumpy and other stuff for making computations on graphical card.What's more important - you should have a knowledge in ML (so stress from programming to math ...).Another story is to use scikit-learn and others (text processing - NLTK, computer vision - opencv python binding) to perform some tasks. Personally, I'm interested (at now) in PYMC (Bayesian statistical models).2k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person

 Answer_content:Python 2 is used mostly, specifically 2.7. The reason being lots of modules which were written before 2.7 can be used with 2.7 with not so much changes, backward compatible.3.1 which is stable version now, but when launched was not quite stable. And there are lots of changes in syntax and functions. Also 2.7 have been stable version for quite a long time. So, you will find many modules for version 2.7 and not for 3.1.For ex: # python 2.7
x = 1
print x

# python 3.1
x = 1
print(x)
Apart from that python 2.7 is quite good and you can go with it. As far as ML is concerned you can totally go with it and use NumPy, SciPy, Scikit for the tasks. The main reason why I am so attached to Python because it lets me focus on problem than syntax. Python is like writing pseudo code.Where should you learn from?I started learning python and did that for two days from "tutorialspoints.com". Python will not take more than a week if you learn it even 2 hours a day. You can find lots of modules for any task you would like to perform using python, for ML I have already specified. So learn it and you will feel great and happy.2k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person

 Answer_content:Learning Python and coding PythonicallyI highly recommend Dive Into Python, and there's both a Python 2 version (http://www.diveintopython.net/to...) and a Python 3 version (http://www.diveinto.org/python3/). It's a good resource for learning Python quickly for those with existing programming knowledge.It's important to learn Python-specific styles and features, or you may end up writing code in C++ or C-style while using Python syntax. E.g. there's rarely a need to manually manipulate an iterator since there are foreach loops, unlike C++ except in C++11. Similarly, Python rarely has a need for iterating over indices in the for(int i =0; i < N; i++) kind of style. Also, the close integration of data structures into the language differs a lot from C and C++. Examples: tuples, lists, dictionaries, and features like list comprehensions and tuple unpacking.As an example, you often see idioms like this in Python:somelist = ["hi", "world", "lol"]
for i, elem in enumerate(somelist):
    print("The {}th element is {}.".format(i, elem))
Note the absence of a C-style for loop, tuple unpacking, and builtins for list manipulation, such as enumerate.Hence you're unlikely to see this:somelist = ["hi", "world", "lol"]
for i in range(len(somelist)):
    print("The {}th element is {}.".format(i, somelist[i]))
And you're the most unlikely to see this, which looks somewhat like C++'s style:somelist = [1,2,3]
it = iter(somelist)
i = 0
while True:
    try:
        v = it.next()
    except StopIteration:
        break
    print("The {}th element is {}".format(i, v))
    i += 1
Although it's impossible to iterate over STL stuff in C++ without the iterator being explicit (excl. C++11).LibrariesAfter that check out some of the common libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas, and maybe a few others (ordered by importance).Python 3 introduced some breaking changes to the language standard and many breaking changes to built-in libraries. Some libraries still lack compatibility with Python 3, which severely slowed its adoption. Although some of the most important packages such as numpy have had Python 3 compatibility for a while, others such as scikit-learn lagged behind.If you do choose to use Python 2, try to use futures (which you can get by importing from __future__) to increase the number of Python 3 features you're using so that the 2to3 automatic conversion tool will be more likely to make clean Python 3 code.3.3k Views · View Upvotes · Answer requested by 1 person

Scikit-imageTheano, Scikit-image etc have very good documentation with tutorials and examples of "how to"sDeep Learning has wonderful tutorials, large data sets for experimentations, startup news, explanation and code samples to generate deep belief networks, recurrent neural nets etc. Inevitably you will be restricted by your CPU as most of the algorithms would be computationally expensive given the nature of computer vision data. Enabling parallel processing with your GPU is the next logical step to reduce the time consuming process of training data sets and making predictions. Playing around with filters and epochs should reduce the processing time a little, however that would come at the cost of a much higher log loss.

Question_title: What skills are needed for machine learning jobs?
Question_details:

Answer_name:Deekshith Marla
 Answer_content:There are mainly two jobs in Machine Learning (ML) i.e. ML Engineer and ML Researcher/Scientist.1. Machine Learning Engineers are the ones who can quickly deliver correct solutions.These engineers are familiar with many languages, API's and data formats so that they can use any open source or third party codes. They know what techniques give the most, in terms of human and total computational time. These engineers analyze the available data, organizational objectives and the ML Algorithms known to operate on what type of problem and to what type of data. Skills required for these jobs are: Data Analysis, Algorithm Selection, Feature Engineering, Cross Validation and Trouble Shooting the solution.2. Machine Learning Researcher is the one who works on 'Leading Edge' problems. They should have a passion to solve unusual problems using their own personal insight and Mathematics. They are expected to modify the existing algorithms and come up with better solutions which provide better results. They have skills which are well suited for tackling problems with no known solutions.There are few other jobs like Data Engineer who needs to know a broad set of tools and be effective in getting the data extracted, scraped, cleaned, joined, merged and sliced for input to the ML Solution. Many of the skills needed to manage Big Data, belong in the Data Engineer category.No machine learning algorithm is complete unless and until you are thorough with Data Structures in depth, Performance under immense load and the Scalability of these Data Structures.Get some idea about these ML algorithms mentioned below as these are very commonly used:1. Radial Basis Support Vector Machine2. Boosted Trees3. Random Forest4. Lasso / Ridge Regression / Elastic Net5. K-Nearest Neighbors6. Neural Networks15.8k Views · View Upvotes
Answer_name:Jonathan A. Cox
 Answer_content:Many of these answers have given you a certain set of tools which have been commonly used at startups in the past. I think its important to note that over your 35+ year career, these tools will change completely. Therefore, its best to familiarize yourself first with the basic concepts and mathematics.Secondly, the ML field is much too diverse to understand dozens of different algorithms in any real depth. I think you should pick a few of the algorithms with the most future promise, and understand those very deeply. That said, there are a few basic things like Naive Bayes, SVM, Perceptrons, Decision Trees, that you should know well.Finally, folks from the startup / non-research world will tell you to focus on algorithms that are "getting long in the tooth" (e.g. SVM) and the Big Data database tools like Hadoop. Since you are starting out, I think you should focus on the architectures which seem most promising for the future: neural networks and SIMD/vector computing (e.g. GPUs). Neural network approaches have recently (<10 years) begun to revolutionize natural language processing, machine vision, speech recognition and many other fields. Because of their power, this is expected to continue. Thus, I would focus on learning and implementing such algorithms yourself with GPU acceleration, and tied into some distributed database. Here's a list of algorithms to consider:1. Deep Belief Nets  or Stacked Denoising Autoencoders2. Convolutional Neural Nets3. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent nets4. Recursive Neural Nets (often used for NLP)5. word2vec and related algorithms for learning words from their contextAnother very promising field is Reenforcement Learning, especially the Q-Learning work from Deep Mind. This is used when you have some delayed reward function (e.g. your score during an Atari game) and you can't directly calculate the gradient of the parameters in your network. After you get some familiarity with the above items, you may want to explore this area since it is very relevant to robotics and more realistically simulates how people or animals actually do most of their learning.--------------------UPDATE: I've come to the opinion that, for the past year, we are starting to see tremendous progress in combining different neural algorithms into a single "deep" system for which the sum is greater than the parts. I expect that the most profound progress will largely come from this direction since the basic building blocks have been established. In part, this is enabled by pre-training the individual blocks before fine tuning the whole system, as well as faster computer clusters. (We will also continue to see progress in individual algorithms, however.)In other words, we are seeing LSTM combined with ConvNets and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to do things like writing sentences describing images (Google/Stanford). Similarly, we saw an Atari playing network made of a ConvNet and MLP trained with reenforcement learning (Deep Mind).You could just as easily add to this list: feeding such composite networks word vectors trained from word2vec/GloVe/skip-gram. Or even a sentiment analysis layer trained with a Recursive Neural Network.  Because neural networks and backpropagation makes it easy to combine/stack layers in arbitrary geometries, and train the conglomeration as a whole system, they can scale to great capability.These hybrid systems, consisting of many different types of neural nets, connected in various topologies, pre-trained individually and fine-tuned together, will continue to demonstrate dramatic new capabilities.--------------------22k Views · View Upvotes

Answer_name:Pavan Teja Chowdhary
 Answer_content:In my opinion, these are some of the necessary skills:UPDATE: I create a repo on github of hundreds of software links that should help get you started: https://github.com/josephmisiti/...1. Python/C++/R/Java - you will probably want to learn all of these languages at some point if you want a job in machine-learning. Python's Numpy and Scipy libraries [2] are awesome because they have similar functionality to MATLAB, but can be easily integrated into a web service and also used in Hadoop (see below). C++ will be needed to speed code up. R [3] is great for statistics and plots, and Hadoop [4] is written in Java, so you may need to implement mappers and reducers in Java (although you could use a scripting language via Hadoop streaming [5])2. Probability and Statistics: A good portion of learning algorithms are based on this theory. Naive Bayes [6], Gaussian Mixture Models [7], Hidden Markov Models [8], to name a few. You need to have a firm understanding of Probability and Stats to understand these models. Go nuts and study measure theory [9]. Use statistics as an model evaluation metric: confusion matrices, receiver-operator curves, p-values, etc.3. Applied Math + Algorithms: For discriminate models like SVMs [10], you need to have a firm understanding of algorithm theory. Even though you will probably never need to implement an SVM from scratch, it helps to understand how the algorithm works. You will need to understand subjects like convex optimization [11], gradient decent [12], quadratic programming [13], lagrange [14], partial differential equations [15], etc. Get used to looking at summations [16].4. Distributed Computing: Most machine learning jobs require working with large data sets these days (see Data Science) [17]. You cannot process this data on a single machine, you will have to distribute it across an entire cluster. Projects like Apache Hadoop [4] and cloud services like Amazon's EC2 [18] makes this very easy and cost-effective. Although Hadoop abstracts away a lot of the hard-core, distributed computing problems, you still need to have a firm understanding of map-reduce [22], distribute-file systems [19], etc. You will most likely want to check out Apache Mahout [20] and Apache Whirr [21].5. Expertise in Unix Tools: Unless you are very fortunate, you are going to need to modify the format of your data sets so they can be loaded into R,Hadoop,HBase [23],etc. You can use a scripting language like python (using re) to do this but the best approach is probably just master all of the awesome unix tools that were designed for this: cat [24], grep [25], find [26], awk [27], sed [28], sort [29], cut [30], tr [31], and many more. Since all of the processing will most likely be on linux-based machine (Hadoop doesnt run on Window I believe), you will have access to these tools. You should learn to love them and use them as much as possible. They certainly have made my life a lot easier. A great example can be found here [1].6. Become familiar with the Hadoop sub-projects: HBase, Zookeeper [32], Hive [33], Mahout, etc. These projects can help you store/access your data, and they scale.7. Learn about advanced signal processing techniques: feature extraction is one of the most important parts of machine-learning. If your features suck, no matter which algorithm you choose, your going to see horrible performance. Depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve, you may be able to utilize really cool advance signal processing algorithms like: wavelets [42], shearlets [43], curvelets [44], contourlets [45], bandlets [46]. Learn about time-frequency analysis [47], and try to apply it to your problems. If you have not read about Fourier Analysis[48] and Convolution[49], you will need to learn about this stuff too. The ladder is signal processing 101 stuff though.Finally, practice and read as much as you can. In your free time, read papers like Google Map-Reduce [34], Google File System [35], Google Big Table [36], The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data [37],etc There are great free machine learning books online and you should read those also. [38][39][40]. Here is an awesome course I found and re-posted on github [41]. Instead of using open source packages, code up your own, and compare the results. If you can code an SVM from scratch, you will understand the concept of support vectors, gamma, cost, hyperplanes, etc. It's easy to just load some data up and start training, the hard part is making sense of it all.Good luck.For more help, ping me on twitter: https://www.twitter.com/josephmi...If you need help with machine learning, hire me: http://www.mathandpencil.com[1] http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04...[2] http://numpy.scipy.org/[3] http://www.r-project.org/[4] http://hadoop.apache.org/[5] http://hadoop.apache.org/common/...[6] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nai...[7] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix...[8] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hid...[9] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea...[10] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sup...[11] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con...[12] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gra...[13] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qua...[14] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag...[15] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par...[16] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum...[17] http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/06...[18] http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/[19] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo...[20] http://mahout.apache.org/[21] http://incubator.apache.org/whirr/[22] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map...[23] http://hbase.apache.org/[24] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat...[25] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep[26] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find[27] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK[28] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed[29] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sor...[30] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut...[31] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr_...[32] http://zookeeper.apache.org/[33] http://hive.apache.org/[34] http://static.googleusercontent....[35]http://static.googleusercontent....[36]http://static.googleusercontent....[37]http://static.googleusercontent....[38] http://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/...[39] http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/...[40] http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ull...[41] https://github.com/josephmisiti/...[42] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav...[43] http://www.shearlet.uni-osnabrue...[44] http://math.mit.edu/icg/papers/F...[45] http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~min...[46] http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr...[47 ]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim...[48] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fou...[49 ]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con...247.1k Views · View Upvotes.logged_out_related_questions_container{border-top:0}.logged_out_related_questions_container .logged_out_related_questions_heading .related_question a{font-size:15px;line-height:1.4;font-weight:400}.question_related.list{background:#fff;z-index:100}.question_related.list .question_link{display:block}.question_related.list .question_link:hover .question_text .view_count{color:#2b6dad}.logged_out_related_questions_container{border-top:1px solid #e2e2e2;padding:18px 0}.logged_out_related_questions_container .logged_out_related_questions_heading{font-size:15px;line-height:1.4;font-weight:bold}.logged_out_related_questions_container .related_question{margin-top:10px}.logged_out_related_questions_container .QuestionText{position:relative}
Answer_name:Carl Shan
 Answer_content:I think that Joseph gave a very comprehensive answer to that question. Undeniably, at the top of that list are the common packages you would encounter as a developer in the field.However, what none of these comments really touches on is the length of time it takes to become familiar with each of these topics. They are actually quite deep and bad answers that results in 100% classification accuracy are common due to over-fitting. If you just want an entry-level position I don't see the need to know anything past Naive Bayes, LDA, and SVM which you can get from most common numpy + scipy packages. Linear algebra will help, but if you understand principal component analysis and singular value decomposition then these things above are 80% of the theory you will need in practice.I would study harder on learning how to get good features more than anything else to be honest. Classifiers are a well-understood mathematical science at this point. Knowing how to get good features and build good kernels is where the biggest bang for your employment buck might be in more advanced roles.Since you are probably going to want to implement these you should know your basic programming languages that most people who recruit use, like those mentioned above.I seriously doubt knowing any fancy mathematics will matter very much. Knowing about reproducing kernel hilbert spaces is interesting, but often in most startups will just want you to keep implementing until it works right on the deployment end. Doing this means you just have to get something to work with the data you have been given. Perhaps this is slightly un-intellectual, but it is often how early-stage ventures work.If you want to be a data-science person and treated as a scientist, or as anything more than a highly paid technician, and work at the management level you should consider formal education in machine learning and computer science. A bright 15 year old can get a job at a startup if he can do the work, but I wouldn't ask him to lead a team unless they had some other extraordinary capabilities that are actually quite rare.48.5k Views · View Upvotes

 Answer_content:I think that comment speaks more to his narcissism than to the actual state of affairs. It also sounds far more autocratic than I’m comfortable with.We have problems. We need solutions. But those solutions are ideas, and there are a number of competent people who can pull them off. There are also people who could stop actively making matters worse. There’s even a lot of overlap between the two categories. And it’s worth acknowledging that many, if not most, of the Democratic and Republican leaders fall in both categories, since there’s also been a disturbing trend to pit one party as the ‘problem’ and the other party as the ‘solution’ (something that I myself have been guilty of).Trump is not the magical key to our salvation. And the way he promotes himself as such is deeply unnerving to me.
